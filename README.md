# CopyOfGoogleClone
A copy of a repository from a Project Graduate Course. This Project was a clone of an initial Google Search Engine. It contains a Web Crawler, PageRanker, Indexer, and Front-end Similar to Google's.
My Focus in the project was to build the indexer, which would use an AWS EMR instance to store indexes of files in an AWS RDS database.
